					<p><a href="http://www.altisliferpg.com">Altis Life RPG</a> is a mission for <a href="http://arma3.com/">ARMA 3</a>, here on <a href="AltisLifeServers.co.uk">AltisLifeServers.co.uk</a> we have a user built server list for anyone to submit to or view! </p>
					<p>On <a href="http://AltisLifeServers.co.uk">AltisLifeServers.co.uk</a> you can submit your server to be listed and have it be advertised for free for all who come on the website!</p>
					<p>Other users then may vote for your server which will push it up the rankings, allowing to be showen higher up the ranking list.</p>
					<p>Servers are cached for half an hour before being updated when someone views them meaning things like the player count may not be completely up to date, but provide a rough estimate.</p>
					<p>If you wish to see an accurate player count we recommend you find the server on GameTracker or click on the server where a banner will be displayed.<p/>
					
					<p>You accept that most of the content on the website you will see is user created and as such <a href="http://AltisLifeServers.co.uk">AltisLifeServers.co.uk</a> does not take responsibility for offensive or derogatory language.</p>
					<p>While we will remove it when it is brought to our attention it has to been seen first before it can be removed.<p>
